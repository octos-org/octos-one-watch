//! Post-generation card validation, and the repair prompt it feeds.
//!
//! One-shot generation drops a random structural detail every few rolls (a
//! row's tap overlay, the `// name:` line, a chip's state key), and the
//! app.md "failure conditions" are prose the model can ignore. This makes
//! them EXECUTABLE: the a2app tree ships machine-checkable rules per app
//! (`apps/<domain>/lint.json`, deployed with the memory tree), the completed
//! card is counted against them, and a violating card triggers ONE automatic
//! repair prompt back to the owning app agent (see the turn-complete handler
//! in main.rs). Rules are plain substring counts — no regex, no DSL parsing —
//! so a rule can never crash a card that would have rendered.
